				<h1>Portfolio</h1>
				<p>Hello, Bonjour, Hola! 
					Welcome everybody to my portfolio page! On this page you'll find information about my proffesional background such as my work experience and education history and also on the bottom right the links to my social media, but before that a bit about me. So my name is Leanne Sobogun and I'm 19 years old. I'm born on Christmas Day (it's not as glam as it may sound and no I don't get two sets of presents) and I'm a Nigerian. I currently go to the University of Exeter. Some of my favourite hobbies include sleeping, eating and sleeping some more. Also binge watching shows especially trash reality tv. I support Arsenal FC and love dogs more than anything on this planet. I love going out with my friends and meeting new people which is why I'm self teaching myself Spanish.

				<h1>Aspirations</h1>
				<p>I have no clue where I want to go in terms of my career and I have come to accept that that is perfectly alright. It has changed multiple times from wanting to become an athlete (I had to stop athletics as my mum thought it interfered with my GCSEs), an investment banker (this was until I confidently said in my economics class that 2+5 is 8, from then on I knew I was dun out ere) and just risking it all and jokingly saying a stripper. All I know is I want to make a difference to peoples lives.....TBC</p>
